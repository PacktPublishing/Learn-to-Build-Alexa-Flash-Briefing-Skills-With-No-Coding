You have probably heard the name Alexa regardless of whether or not you own an Amazon device.

1
00:06.750 --> 00:13.110
Alexa is the name you call out when you have a question when using an Amazon Echo device or Alexa-enabled

2
00:13.110 --> 00:14.470
speaker.

3
00:14.760 --> 00:21.960
Alexa is the virtual assistant with a female voice created by Amazon that allows you to talk in a conversational

4
00:21.960 --> 00:22.690
manner.

5
00:22.990 --> 00:29.790
It assists you in performing day-to-day tasks such as playing music, controlling smartphone gadgets, giving the

6
00:29.790 --> 00:37.380
ability to dim lights, lock doors or adjusting your thermostat. Even though you associate Alexa with

7
00:37.380 --> 00:40.810
products like the Amazon Echo or Fire TV Cube,

8
00:41.040 --> 00:44.090
You can't actually go out and buy an Alexa.

9
00:44.100 --> 00:48.680
Most people associate Alexa as the name of the voice that comes out of the Alexa-enabled

10
00:48.690 --> 00:57.270
speakers. Essentially Alexa is to Amazon as what Siri is to Apple or what the Google Assistant

11
00:57.300 --> 00:58.720
is to Google.

12
00:58.740 --> 01:05.430
Alexa is the voice you can ask questions and get answers to such as What is the weather today.

13
01:05.510 --> 01:09.620
However under the covers it goes a little deeper than that.

14
01:09.810 --> 01:15.180
When you communicate with Alexa you are communicating with a cloud based service.

15
01:15.210 --> 01:21.900
This is actually the Alexa Voice Service which was created by Amazon and is an intelligent voice

16
01:21.900 --> 01:28.740
recognition and natural language processing service that allows you to voice enable any connected device

17
01:28.740 --> 01:32.390
that has a microphone and a speaker.

18
01:32.460 --> 01:39.780
Alexa is simply the wake word that alerts the service to start listening to your voice by default, although 

19
01:39.870 --> 01:47.760
this can be changed. In order to extend the capabilities of Alexa, Amazon has made available to developers

20
01:47.790 --> 01:57.270
and programmers the Alexa Skills Kit. The Alexa Skills Kit is a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation

21
01:57.330 --> 02:06.150
and code that makes it easy to create new skills for Alexa. Skills enable customers to create a personalized

22
02:06.150 --> 02:07.740
experience.

23
02:07.740 --> 02:13.830
There are now tens of thousands of skills from companies like Starbucks, Uber, Capital One and many other

24
02:13.830 --> 02:15.090
companies.

25
02:15.090 --> 02:22.530
The great news is the ability to create a new skill for Alexa is now available to anyone. Using a voice

26
02:22.530 --> 02:26.550
user interface and the capabilities of the Alexa Voice Service,

27
02:26.550 --> 02:30.100
the possibilities are endless for developers.
